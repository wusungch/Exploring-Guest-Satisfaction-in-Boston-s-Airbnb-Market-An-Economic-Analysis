# Introduction
The proliferation of the short-term rental market, with Airbnb at its helm, has piqued substantial academic curiosity, particularly within hospitality and tourism studies. This sector's expansion has led scholars to investigate the intricacies of guest satisfaction, a determinant crucial for the platform's success and the economic viability of its hosts. The scope of this research spans a comprehensive array of factors, including property attributes, host behaviors, and their broader implications on both guests and local communities.

Previous studies, such as those by Guttentag et al. (2018)[3] and Dogru et al. (2020)[2], have described the impact of amenities, location, and host responsiveness on enhancing guest satisfaction. These themes are expanded upon by Zervas et al. (2017)[6] through the lens of signaling theory, exploring the influence of host attributes, particularly superhost status, on establishing trust and perceived quality among guests. Complementing these perspectives, Gibbs et al. (2018)[3] apply the hedonic pricing model to dissect how property and location-specific features are factored into pricing strategies, subsequently affecting guest perceptions and satisfaction.

Amidst this landscape, the role of technology in mediating the hospitality experience, especially through online reviews and digital communication, has been scrutinized by Liang et al. (2017)[5]. Their work highlights the evolving nature of host-guest interactions and their impact on satisfaction levels. Despite these extensive explorations, a gap remains in holistically integrating economic theories with empirical evidence to explain guest satisfaction within the Airbnb ecosystem comprehensively. 

Therefore, at the heart of this investigation is the economic question: How do market dynamics, consumer preferences, and pricing strategies within Boston's Airbnb market influence guest satisfaction? This question prompts an examination of the main response variable, review_scores_rating, and its relationship with subratings on location, communication, and value, and with relevant predictors. The study further delves into how specific predictors impact subratings on location (review_scores_location), communication (review_scores_communication), and value (review_scores_value). These subratings offer a granular view of guest satisfaction, breaking it down into components directly influenced by host and listing characteristics.
